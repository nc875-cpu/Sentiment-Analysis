## SCRAPING FOR DATA

â€¢	Fetch Reddit posts about iPhone 17 using PRAW (Reddit API)

â€¢	Clean and preprocess text (lowercasing, removing URLs/mentions/punctuation, lemmatization, stopwords removal)

â€¢	Perform lexicon-based sentiment analysis (VADER + TextBlob)

â€¢	Train machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM) for sentiment classification

â€¢	Build deep learning LSTM/BiLSTM models for context-aware sentiment detection

â€¢	Visualize model performance

â€¢	Save processed data and sentiment results to CSV
